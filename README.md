# MyReads Project

This project was initialized using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and modified by [Willian R Sabi√£o](https://www.linkedin.com/in/willianrsabiao/en/) as a first project of the [React Nanodegree of Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

The project is built in React.js and ES6.

That's a shelf of books with 3 sections: Currently, Reading, Want to Read and Read. Each section has books that the user can move to another shelf. The user can add more books using the search component to look for more books on Udacity's API(made for Udacity's students).

This project is made to challenge the students to use all the knowledge learned in the classes.

## TL;DR

To see the project working:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`
* start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Contributing

This repository is used to study only.
